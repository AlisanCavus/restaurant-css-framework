### Hi there,

##### Let me introduce you the NomNom. NomNom is an Asian Restaurant focused on two cuisine. Japanese cuisine and Thai Cuisine. We have two branches; one is in Brussels and the other one is in Antwerp. 
##### Whole project is a made up. There is no such place like that.

---------
At first I planned the home page and some general styling like background, fonts, colors, etc. At that point I made a navbar that took a hole day and a failure (It was okay only in local view but when it comes to push that stuff in github pages it was a disaster.) So, after that I need a footer and Jumbotron for the home page. That thing took too much time because I need to make it fancy to be able to attract potential customers. It gave me pain and joy at very same time.
After that I wanted to use accordion menu. In branch section you can reach out the branch informations (locations opening hours etc.) In Reservation page you can make a reservation as expected. You can check the photos of restaurant in Gallery with paginations. We have 2 branches so there is seperate gallery for each branch. Honestly It looks good on large devices but I have to improve these galleries in mobile view. 

I had 4 days to complete it. It looks good for now but needs improvements as obvious. I wish you will enjoy.
